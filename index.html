      <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        We strive to create a collaborative, inclusive, and innovative
        environment where team members feel empowered to push boundaries and
        achieve excellence in their craft. Our mission is to deliver
        high-quality solutions that meet and exceed our clients' expectations.
      </p>

        <h2>Team Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Commit to meeting once a week, and be prepared to share at the meeting.</li>
            <li>If we fall behind schedule we will set aside extra time when all or most members are free to catch up on the work.</li>
            <li>We will meet weekly and decide the meeting time for the next week at the end of each week of work, to ensure that everyone is free for each meeting.</li>
            <li>Be willing to share when something doesn't work as intended, only by helping each other can we succeed.</li>
            <li>If someone falls behind we work together to achieve our goals, if they do not agree then we will reach out to the instructor.</li>
            <li>Respect others' time, people may be busy and need extra time to properly implement, but do not let it become a pattern, as you then take away others' time.</li>
            <li>When working together make our work our main priority that way we can spend time set aside on work properly focused.</li>
